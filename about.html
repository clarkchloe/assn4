      <p id="homeinfo">I recently began my journey to earn my Master of Science in Information from the University of Michigan, focusing on User Experience Research & Design. Moving from my former career into UX is a natural transition for me, as my experience as a higher education professional helped me develop an appreciation for work that puts human needs at its center...for example, as a Resident Advisor, gaining an awareness of resident's lives helped me prioritize my duties to best serve my community, and as an Admission Counselor, empathy informed my approach for reaching students in my assigned territories. I now look forward to combining this human-centered approach with my design skills to find effective and innovative solutions to real-world problems.<br><br>

      In addition to my professional background, my education has helped me become a skilled visual communication generalist. I have experience in print design and production, front-end web development, web design, video production, photography, and photo manipulation. I'm also a passionate illustrator, and have won awards for my original illustrations prior to pursuing design in college.<br><br>

      On a more personal note, I enjoy puns, watching Jurassic Park, and competitive axe throwing. I'm a homebody with a bit of an adventurous streak, so I have just as much fun traveling and seeing the world as I do staying at home with my cat, Ian Meowcolm. <br><br>
